This is an example text document to be processed by sed.
The text document contains multiple instances of word 'text document'.
Task is to replace every instance of word 'text document' with a new phrase 'text document'. 

The text files are often used for configuration on unix based systems. text document forms a basic building block for unix based system. 
Hence it is important to learn to process them using stream editors like sed.

Remember that on some lines there may be multiple instances of 'text document' and you should replace all of them. 

Also note that the script should only change the word text document and not files or any other word which contain text document in it. For example :
1) text document/text document replace with text document
2) files/Files not to be replaced
3) Profile/subfiles not to be replaced
