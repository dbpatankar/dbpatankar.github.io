This is an example file to be processed by sed.
The file contains multiple instances of word 'file'.
Task is to replace every instance of word 'file' with a new phrase 'text document'. 

The text files are often used for configuration on unix based systems. File forms a basic building block for unix based system. 
Hence it is important to learn to process them using stream editors like sed.

Remember that on some lines there may be multiple instances of 'file' and you should replace all of them. 

Also note that the script should only change the word file and not files or any other word which contain file in it. For example :
1) file/File replace with text document
2) files/Files not to be replaced
3) Profile/subfiles not to be replaced
