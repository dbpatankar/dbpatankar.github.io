Input and output files can be found at 
https://dbpatankar.github.io/examples/example9.inp
https://dbpatankar.github.io/examples/example9.out

The input file has 3 records but not one record per line. Such as 

1 2 3
4 5 6


7 8 9
10 11 12


13 14 15
16 17 18


It can be seen that above three records are separated by 2 carriage returns and each record is separated on two lines. The output required is as follows 

1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18

Do not use getline from awk.
