This was an overnight sky observation program arranged for the people from all ages with interest in observational astronomy. The participants were introduced to the preliminaries of naked-eye sky observation and use of telescopes in observational astronomy. Various planets and deep-sky objects were viewed through available telescopes. There were talks and 'QA sessions' in the middle which were solely handled by me.
